# App Brand Statement

Roadie Relief is a web application built with those touring crew members left unemployed by COVID.

The live music touring industry grosses tens of billon of dollars annually worldwide.

March 2020 saw virtually all major tours and festivals either cancelled or postponed, with the hopes of returning in 2021. Touring is the largest piece of revenue for musical acts, but it's not just the musicians that are affected.

As these venues and festivals have been shuttered, tens of thousands of workers that depend on live music for their income are now out of work.

The target users of this application are those out of work roadies. I hope to create an online community where people can share work available in cities across the US, as well as online resources offering grants or other assistance. And, in an effort to support those artists that these crews help put on shows each night, a page dedicated to upcoming livestreams
